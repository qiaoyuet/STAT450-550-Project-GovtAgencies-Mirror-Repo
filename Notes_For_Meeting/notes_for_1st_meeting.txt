[ GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ] : Jan 25 THUR

- Context: We have 2 datasets, both concerning civil services

	> civil services in China are very decentralized (few located in Beijing)

	> civil services staffing varies from level to level
		LEVELS: province -> city -> prefecture -> county -> etc.
		  - most are at county level
		BRANCHES:  state, local / district

	> tax collection
		- duration: 1992 - 2012 / 2013 
		- around 800,000 ppl involved (11% of civil service staff)
		- 2nd largest branch of civil services

	> EPA
		- around 200,000 ppl
		- 5th / 6th largest branch of civil services

		- duration: 2004 - 2011
		- overall, a smaller dataset than 'tax collection'
		- Staffing at the county level has also increased

- Data:
	> For tax collection: 25 years, 30 provinces, 100 observations
	> Some sample variables
		- education level (has increased over time)
		- age (has increased over time)
		- turnover rate
		- titles / positions
		- types of tax bureau
			i. district / branch bureau
				+ stationary staff
				+ actually deals with tax collection (???)

			ii. DAE - "directly affiliated entities"
				+ non-stationary staff ("contract"-like)
				+ changes from year to year

			* I assume that some of these variables may also be shown in the EPA dataset as well
	> Both datasets are have the structure of panel data
		- however, we might not have too many observations

- Client requests:
	> data visualization
		- capturing "shrinks", constants and changes in the data

	> interpretation and explanation of the data

	> sample Qs:
		+ What prompts / determines staffing?
			- there may be factors not included in the given 2 datasets that may contribute to this ...
			- look for relations / patterns
			- staffing levels are correlated with economic indicators
		+ Evolution in the data? What can we see from the data?
		+ Do we assign more staff during certain tasks / time periods?
		+ Are there any variations in staffing trends within provinces / counties / etc. ?
		+ Are there any significant similarities / differences (comparison) between the 2 datasets?
		+ Are there any relations between the staffing and the economy?
			(e.g. - better economy, more staffing? )
		+ Are there some "synchronicity" appearing between the 2 datasets?
		+ Are there significant "concentrations" (???) at certain levels of staffing?
		+ Possible data cleaning?
		+ For the EPA dataset, how does departmental staffing evolve?

	> 2 general aspects:
		+ "storytelling" of the datasets - rather then just selecting some plots
			^ interpretations
			^ explanations
			^ elaborations

		+ analytics 
			^ stats stuff

- IDEAS:
	> consider panel regression 
		- Would like to control for economic changes
	
	> for the 'tax collection' dataset, consider combining the 2 branches
		(local / district & state ) for a full depiction

	> we might want to find other related datasets, albeit optional
		^ e.g. - check chinese government sites for economic datasets

	> in terms of persective, we might want to focus more on pattern / trend-finding as opposed to trying to find causal relations
		* correlation != causation LOL *

	> consider cluster analysis?
	

- COMMENTS: (from client or miscellaneous stuff)
	> "overall, we have observed that the staffing in the county level has been increasing" (???)

	> *client is really stressing on the panel regression approach*
		^ THIS

	> THERE MAY BE QUITE A BIT OF DATA CLEANING REQUIRED !!!
		- client started cleaning the data but stopped
			* should we be aware of how the client partially cleaned the data? *
		- probably lots of missing values

	> the client can provide more data as necessary, so ask (???)
		- e.g. - size of total civil services across time periods

	> staffing and tax policy changes are generally jointly caused by some other factor

	> overall, it is difficult to track explanations
		- we are dealing with "institutional variables"
		- what we have is essentially just observational values, which are often difficult to find causal relations from

- Q & A
	> Are there any other response variables of interest?
		+ hard to say
		+ maybe total tax collected (revenue)?
		+ "we will need to control for more things" (???)
		+ we don't have very many dependent variables ...

			* no concrete response to this questions; client is open to new ideas *

	> How was the data collected?
		+ hand-collected by students
		+ is part of the "tax yearbook" and "EPA yearbook"
			^ which are currently unexamined public data
		+ other data can be grabbed from UBC's subscriptions (to economic datasets / info / journals / stuff )

	> client is open to new visualization software and techniques
		+ Wants that whatever is produced has the ability to be changed easily (i.e. name changes)

	> What were some significant changes in tax policies during the time interval where the data was collected, if any?
		+ many significant changes

		+ in addition, there may be periods where the bureaus / organizations relabeled staff positions!

		+ for example, during the period 1999 to 2002, we notice alot of change across agencies
			^ during this time, there were more experimentation in the staffing (more DAEs, for example)

	> How autonomous are the different levels?
		^ e.g. provincial / state / county

		+ for the EPA:
			- it's not entirely "top-down"
			- the national ministry generally sets the law, but lower-tier organizations have a lot of autonomy / independence / room for movement

		+ staffing decision / divisions may often depend on the level
			- for example, consider "local" branches
				^ they have less power, that is, less revenue is collected
				^ however, they have a slighly higher overall education level
				^ there are clearer signs of autonomous decisions that are made here, in terms of staffing and other things
				^ we notice that the staffing structures change more often with this group

	> To clarify, are there overlaps between the different levels?
		^ e.g. - if there are 10 ppl in the "county" level, are they included in the totals for the "provincial" level? 

		- for EPA, definitely not. There's no overlap in levels in terms of people
		- for 'tax collection', mostly not but there may be occasional changes

	> For comparisons of organizations, do you have any preferences in terms of time periods / approaches? 
		- nope, I (the client) is pretty open, no specific preference

	> Why the preference for panel models / regressions?
		- "it allows you to control for variables that you generally cannot control for" 

		- COMMENT: in general, the observations / values we deal with in social science, esp. politics and governmental changes, are very "sticky"
			-> that is, if we are just looking at the data, we need a lot of it to see that a particular change has been made
			-> effects of governmental changes takes a long time to appear
