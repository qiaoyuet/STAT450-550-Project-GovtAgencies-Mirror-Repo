## Case Summary

The project aims to better understand the distribution of the employment for China's government braches: taxation administration services and Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs), and mainly, the number of staffing at each government level, from year 1992 to 2013. Employment in taxation services are diviede into two branches covering the state tax bureau (STB) and local tax bureau (LTB). 
The project is interested in finding whether there is, or when there is, and by how much there is a change in the organization of the tax offices. Are there any relationships among the age composition, education levels, and the amount of work force per area?

This project consists of the following objectives: 
- 1. To visualize data in a clear and appealing ways to identify any patterns and trends for government staffing.  
- 2. To formulate a hypthesis to test any factor's significance on the staffing numbers.
- 3. To create a model that defines the staffing at various levels
