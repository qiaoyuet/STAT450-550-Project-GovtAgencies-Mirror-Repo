-- SOS MEETUP NOTES --
----------------------

>> MARCH 5th MON 

- impudence used on 2006 TAX data -> to account for both temporary and permanent workers
	^ not sure what the impudence formula / method is 

- STB vs LTB plotting -> "dimensions of variation"

- when modeling, think more about the variables you are including
	-> the fact that it is there doesn't imply that it has to be in your model

	^ total as opposed to the age or any specific level
		^ start with the total staffing values, then more specific later

- IDEA: spline-fitting -> then cluster coefficients
	^ separate by similarities and differences; clusters of provinces, e.g.
	^ -> check paper (similar method)

	^ consider adding econ/demo variables later? currently just across times

- main focus: differences across provinces (CLIENT OBJECTIVE)

- perhaps drop the notions of missing values? (grad students)

- province groupings / clusters will be pretty good 
	^ quality over quantity of results and questions answered

- >> to fit s-spline, we also need some points around the "time"
		^ we need some "variation" -> consider age, education

		^ IDEA: consider econ/demo-vars
			-> provinces within econ/demo-var grouping levels = "pseudo-replicate"
			-> need to think about what is your model replicates
				^ time? age groupings? education groupings?

- IDEA: ANOVA over provinces?

- IDEA: differences over time? lag?
	^ smoothing average? 
	^ differences over subsequent years for each province (time-points)
		^^ is average difference the same over the provinces?

	^ think more about this one
	^ (time becomes the replicates here)
		-> /province = 10 observations (staffing value per year)

- grad students working on EPB datasets?

- regarding spline cluster
	. to fit spline, we need to have "measured provinces multiple times"
		^ once again, where will the replications occur?
			(TAX: Units, EPB: Department)

- make sure you know the limitations or how to express the question from
	the method
	^ note the assumptions made 
		^ e.g. - affects of ___ is the same over all 
			   - department 

- WHAT IS THE VARIABLE OF REPLICATION?
	^ province should NOT be the replication 
	^ should we collapse some of the years?
		- all observations across a time range / period 
			^ source of variation

- IDEA: consider collapsing into 2 time ranges (half and half?)
	>> see if we detect any changes between them

- unsupervised clustering on the splines?
	^ cluster analysis ("functional data analysis")
		^ i.e. - we are just clustering curves << we end up with ~30 curves
			^ look into how this can be done

- NOTE: we probably can't fit different models
	-> once again, cluster on the spline curves

- TODO: spline per province using age 
	^ splines will give you the coefficients < cluster coefficients
	^ the line will end up being crude
		>> (smoothing? <- then we need variation)

	^ similar on departments for EPB

	^ OR vector over time that represents the province (10-d vector)
		^ but we might have a bunch of dimensions
			-> consider PCA to reduce dimensionality
